# # Modal analysis of a free-floating steel circle

# ## Description

# Vibration analysis of a beam simply supported in one plane, and clamped
# in another. The results are compared with analytical expressions.

# ## Goals

##
# ## Definition of the basic inputs

# The finite element code realize on the basic functionality implemented in this
# package.
using FinEtools

# The material parameters may be defined with the specification of the units.
# The elastic properties are:
E = 200.0 * phun("GPa") 
nu = 0.3;

# The mass density is
rho = 8000 * phun("kg/m^3")
# Here are the cross-sectional dimensions and the length of the beam between supports.
radius = 1.0 * phun("m"); diameter = 0.1 * phun("m");

# ## Reference frequencies 

# There will be 6 rigid body modes (zero natural frequencies).

# ## Cross-section

# Cross-sectional properties are incorporated in the cross-section property. The
# three arguments supplied are functions. All are returning "constants". In
# particular the first two functions each return the dimension of the
# cross-section as a constant(the beam has a uniform cross-section); the third
# function defines the orientation of the cross-section in the global Cartesian
# coordinates. `[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]` is the vector that together with the tangent
# to the midline curve of the beam spans the $x_1x_2$ plane of the local
# coordinates for the beam.
using FinEtoolsFlexBeams.CrossSectionModule: CrossSectionCircle
cs = CrossSectionCircle(s -> diameter/2, s -> [1.0, 0.0, 0.0])

# We will generate
n = 20
# beam elements along the member.

# ## Material

# Material properties can be now used to create a material: isotropic elasticity model of the `FinEtoolsDeforLinear` package is instantiated.
using FinEtoolsDeforLinear
material = MatDeforElastIso(DeforModelRed3D, rho, E, nu, 0.0)

# ## Fields

# Now we start constructing the discrete finite element model.
# We begin by constructing the requisite fields, geometry and displacement.
# These are the so-called "configuration variables", all initialized to 0.
# This is that geometry field.
geom0 = NodalField(fens.xyz)
# This is the displacement field, three unknown displacements per node.
u0 = NodalField(zeros(size(fens.xyz, 1), 3))
# This is the rotation field, three unknown rotations per node are represented
# with a rotation matrix, in total nine numbers. The utility function
# `initial_Rfield`
using FinEtoolsFlexBeams.RotUtilModule: initial_Rfield
Rfield0 = initial_Rfield(fens)
# Here we verify the number of nodes and the number of degrees of freedom in the
# rotation field per node.
@show nents(Rfield0)
@show ndofs(Rfield0)

# Finally, this is the displacement and rotation field for incremental changes,
# incremental displacements and incremental rotations. In total, 6 unknowns per
# node.
dchi = NodalField(zeros(size(fens.xyz, 1), 6))

# There are no support conditions.
applyebc!(dchi)
# The  the number of free
# (unknown) degrees of freedom is equal to the total number of degrees of freedom in the system.

# ## Assemble the global discrete system

using FinEtoolsFlexBeams.FEMMCorotBeamModule: FEMMCorotBeam
femm = FEMMCorotBeam(IntegDomain(fes, GaussRule(1, 2)), material);

# For disambiguation we will refer to the stiffness and mass functions by qualifying them with the corotational-beam module, `FEMMCorotBeamModule`.
using FinEtoolsFlexBeams.FEMMCorotBeamModule
CB = FEMMCorotBeamModule
# Thus we can construct the stiffness and mass matrix as follows:
# Note that the finite element machine is the first argument. This provides
# access to the integration domain. The next argument is the geometry field,
# followed by the displacement, rotations, and incremental
# displacement/rotation fields. 
K = CB.stiffness(femm, geom0, u0, Rfield0, dchi);
M = CB.mass(femm, geom0, u0, Rfield0, dchi);
# We can compare the size of the stiffness matrix with the number of degrees of
# freedom that are unknown (20).
@show size(K)

##
# ## Solve the free-vibration problem

oshift = (2*pi*5)^2

# The Arnoldi algorithm implemented in the well-known `Arpack` package is used
# to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem with the sparse matrices. As is
# common in structural dynamics, we request the smallest eigenvalues in
# absolute value (`:SM`). 
using Arpack
evals, evecs, nconv = eigs(K + oshift * M, M; nev=neigvs, which=:SM);
# First  we should check that the requested eigenvalues actually converged:
@show nconv == neigvs

# The eigenvalues (i. e. the squares of the angular frequencies) are returned in
# the vector `evals`. The mode shapes constitute the columns of the matrix `evecs`.
@show size(evecs)
# The natural frequencies are obtained from the squares of the angular
# frequencies. We note the use of `sqrt.` which broadcast the square root over
# the array `evals`.
fs = sqrt.([max(0, e - oshift) for e in evals]) / (2 * pi);

# ## Comparison of computed and analytical results

# The approximate and analytical frequencies are now reported.
println("Approximate frequencies: $fs [Hz]")

# ## Visualize vibration modes

# The animation will show one of the vibration modes overlaid on the undeformed geometry. The configuration during the animation needs to reflect rotations. The function `update_rotation_field!` will update the rotation field given a vibration mode.
